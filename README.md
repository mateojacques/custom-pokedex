# Custom Pokedex

Custom Pokedex built with React, HTML, CSS and JS. I used Axios to make the API calls from the Pokeapi.  
I left out the usage of Bootstrap library as I was informed that UI development with HTML and CSS was an important part of this test. Also, I opted for the usage of vanilla CSS instead of Sass, to preserve the simplicity of the project.
